/**
 * Thread safe state management class to keep track of what state the interface is in
 * to determine if an action invocation or service call is currently allowed.
 *
 * The states correspond to what actions are called, i.e. `job_idle` oder `job_env`.
 * Additionally the WAITING and INTERNAL_ERROR states are used to represent that no
 * action is currently being processed or an invocation resulted in an error state.
 *
 * Service calls are only allowed if the internal state is RUNNING_JOB. To keep track of what actions
 * have been triggered and what services invoked call the corresponding begin and end methods.
 *
 * State changes to RUNNING_JOB or IDLING are only allowed from the WAITING state.
 * A transition to the INTERNAL_ERROR state is always possible, but cannot be undone.

 * If a state change is attempted that is not allowed, the INTERNAL_ERROR state is entered.
 * If a service call fails its return value indicates the reason but INTERNAL_ERROR
 * is not automatically entered you will need to do this manually.
